# Getting Started with Pomodoro Timer Pro
Welcome to your new productivity companion! This guide will walk you through the main features of the app so you can get started with focused work right away.

### 1. Set Your Task
Before you start the timer, it’s a great idea to define what you want to accomplish.

* **Enter your task**: In the input box at the top, type in your goal for the next work session (e.g., "Draft the project introduction").

### 2. Start the Timer
Once you have your task in mind, you're ready to go!

* **Click the** `Start` **button**. The timer will begin counting down from your set work duration (default is 25 minutes).

* **Keyboard Shortcut**: You can also press the `Spacebar` to start or pause the timer.

### 3. Track Your Progress Automatically
As you complete sessions, the app does the tracking for you.

* **Today's Log**: When a work session ends, the task you entered is automatically added to "Today's Log" with a timestamp. This creates a record of your accomplishments for the day.

* **Goal Tracker**: The app keeps count of how many Pomodoros you've completed and shows your progress toward your daily goal.

### 4. Work and Break Cycles
The Pomodoro Technique is all about alternating between focused work and short breaks. The app handles this for you.

* After a **work** session, the timer will automatically start a **short break** (default 5 minutes).

* After every 4 work sessions, it will automatically start a **long break** (default 15 minutes) to help you reset.

### 5. Customize Your Experience (Settings)
Make the app work for you by personalizing the settings.

1. **Click the gear icon** (⚙️) in the top-right corner to open the Settings panel.

2. **Adjust the durations** for your Work, Short Break, and Long Break times.

3. **Set your Daily Goal** for the number of Pomodoros you want to complete.

4. Click `Save` to apply your changes. The timer will reset with the new settings.

That's it! You're all set to have a productive and focused day.
